# Secure-Message-Transfer-System

In this project, messages can be sent to the other users of the same platform.   
The sent messages are encrypted using the cipher and key provided by the sender.   
The key, cipher method and encrypted text are stored in the database and then retrieved for the reciever to decrypt to view the original message.
